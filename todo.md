##notes: 
- Partition downloaded files: mk 2 dirs, one w/ strict the other w/o also keep a record of popular libs
- To Partition strict packages: cd to GetApps, then bash < shellcmd strict packs are in Apps/strictapps

##issues: 

- relevant files: 
        - HasBang (getting cpp into here)
        - Cpp (trying out cpp)
        - strictapps (30+ strict files)
        - HasStrict (too many open files)
        - hash (files with hashes)
- new strategy: remove all lines with `#define` `#if` `#else`

##questions we can ask about packages
- how many bangs?
- how big
- use what lib

##helpful resources:
- glob lib for shell cmd

##todo: 
- [x] get extensions
- [x] finish monad practice
- [ ] finish partition
- [ ] get list of pop lib
- [ ] see how unsafe affects type sys
- [ ] automatic github issue tracking
- [ ] Log: time command names
