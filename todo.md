##notes: 
- Partition downloaded files: mk 2 dirs, one w/ strict the other w/o also keep a record of popular libs
- To Partition strict packages: cd to GetApps, then bash < shellcmd strict packs are in Apps/strictapps

##issues: 

- All kinds of errors when parsing
- Idea: Assuming it is very straightforward to build packages, is it possible to
        pause the build at parsing stage? Is the assumption true?

##questions we can ask about packages
- how many bangs?
- how big
- use what lib

##helpful resources:
- glob lib for shell cmd

##todo: 
- [x] get extensions
- [x] finish monad practice
- [ ] finish partition
- [ ] get list of pop lib
- [ ] see how unsafe affects type sys
- [ ] automatic github issue tracking
- [ ] Log: time command names
