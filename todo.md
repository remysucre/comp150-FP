##notes: 
- Partition downloaded files: mk 2 dirs, one w/ strict the other w/o also keep a record of popular libs
- To Partition strict packages: cd to GetApps, then bash < shellcmd strict packs are in Apps/strictapps

##issues: 

- Profiling: 
  - building requires huge amount of packages (sandbox?)

- Partition strict: 
  - to define macros require packages installed

##questions we can ask about packages
- how many bangs?
- how big
- use what lib

##helpful resources:
- glob lib for shell cmd

##todo: 
- [ ] get list of pop lib
- [ ] profile strict code vs non-strict
- [ ] review & clean up
  - [x] organize & document repo
  - [x] cis 194
  - [ ] generate log
- [ ] monad practice
  - [ ] pld reading
  - [ ] start real world
  - [ ] papers
  - [ ] books/tutorials
  - [ ] exercises
- [ ] finish partition
  - [x] too many open files
  - [ ] cpphs options
- [x] look @ paper
