##notes: 
- Partition downloaded files: mk 2 dirs, one w/ strict the other w/o also keep a record of popular libs

##issues: 

- can getCmd be pointfree?
- is there a way to automaticall track issues from keywords in files (comments)?
- not sure if we want to upload 2GB of source code to github, so git is ignoreing Apps/
- concurrency in partition?
- Monadic Bool in [Sys.FilePath](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/FileManip-0.1/docs/System-FilePath-Find.html#t%3AFilterPredicate)
