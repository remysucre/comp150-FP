##notes: 
- Partition downloaded files: mk 2 dirs, one w/ strict the other w/o also keep a record of popular libs
- To Partition strict packages: cd to GetApps, then bash < shellcmd strict packs are in Apps/strictapps

##issues: 

- last function for monad practice
- how to get rid of module names in AllHs
- a lot of parse fails

##questions we can ask about packages
- how many bangs?
- how big
- use what lib

##helpful resources:
- glob lib for shell cmd

##todo: 
- [ ] finish partition
- [x] find large packages
- [ ] get list of pop lib
- [ ] see how unsafe affects type sys
- [ ] automatic github issue tracking
- [ ] Log: time command names
- [ ] finish monad practice
- [ ] clean up everything!
