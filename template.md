To compile
- ghc --make GMain.hs

To run
- Create a file `files.txt` in this directory.
- Write down the paths for every file needed to compile your program, with the main module first.
   For instance, if I want to compile a program `main.hs` with three files `fileA.hs, fileB.hs, dir/fileC.hs`, my `files.txt` is
  
> main.hs  
> fileA.hs  
> fileB.hs  
> dir/fileC.hs

- Run ./GMain
- The last output line of output (barring errors) will contain the location of the main module of the most optimized program.
  `[path: \"files/tmp112/main\", vec: 33]` means that the optimized file is in `./files/tmp112/`
