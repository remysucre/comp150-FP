# Example configuration file for htsn. For this to take effect, you
# would need to place it in either the user or global configuration
# directories.
#
# For a user, that's either $HOME/.htsnrc on Unix or
# %APPDATA%\.htsnrc (e.g. C:\Users\<username>\Application
# Data\.htsnrc) on Windows.
#
# The global configuration directory is determined by Cabal. The
# "sysconfdir" parameter during the "configure" step will be used. On
# Unix, it's probably /etc, and this file will need to  go in
# /etc/htsnrc.

# Run in the background as a daemon?
#
# Default: false
#
# daemonize = true


# A list of hostnames that supply the feed. You probably don't need to
# change this, but you can.
#
# Default: ["feed1.sportsnetwork.com",
#           "feed2.sportsnetwork.com",
#           "feed3.sportsnetwork.com"]
#
# feed_hosts = [ "hostname1", "hostname2", ... ]


# If you specify a file path here, logs will be written to it
# (possibly in addition to syslog). Can be either a relative or
# absolute path. It will not be auto-rotated; use something like
# logrotate for that.
#
# Default: none
#
# log_file = "/var/log/htsn/htsn.log"


# How verbose should the logs be? Valid levels are,
#
#   "DEBUG", "INFO", "WARNING", "ERROR"
#
# (there are others, but we don't emit them.) The debug output is
# extremely verbose and will not be written to syslog even if you try.
#
# Default: "INFO"
#
# log_level = "WARNING"


# By default, XML files will be written to the current working
# directory. Often this is not desirable, and you would rather save
# them to a specific location. Specify it here.
#
# Default: "."
#
# output_directory = "/var/lib/htsn"


# The password associated with your TSN username.
#
# Default: none (required)
#
# password = "whatever"


# (Daemon mode only) Create a PID file in the given location. This is
# used by the init system on Unix to keep track of the running
# daemon.
#
# If necessary, its parent directory will be created with owner/group
# set to the appropriate user/group, but at most one directory will be
# created (that is, we won't create an entire directory tree).
#
# Default: /run/htsn/htsn.pid
#
# pidfile = /var/run/htsn/htsn.pid


# (Daemon mode only) Run htsn as the specified system grup. The PID
# file is written before privileges are dropped, so the only
# privileges needed by htsn are those necessary to write the XML files
# and (optionally) the log file.
#
# Default: the current group
#
# run_as_group = "htsn"


# (Daemon mode only) Run htsn as the specified system user. The PID
# file is written before privileges are dropped, so the only
# privileges needed by htsn are those necessary to write the XML files
# and (optionally) the log file.
#
# Default: the current user
#
# run_as_user = "htsn"

# Do you want to log to syslog? On Windows this will attempt to
# communicate (over UDP) with a syslog daemon on localhost, which will
# most likely not work.
#
# Default: false
#
# syslog = true


# The username used to connect to the feed.
#
# Default: none (required)
#
# username = "whoever"
